#SwiftModbus

## Summary

This project exists to create a stable Modbus protocol library in the Swift language for use in iOS or macOS apps. If you want to contribute, please feel free to clone a copy and work on it. 

## ToDo

Well we gotta get this thing off the ground somehow. I want to be able to input an array of Modbus addresses and have functions that determine how many polls to do, determine the function codes and then return an array of Modbus commands. 

This array of commands should be able to be fed directly to a serial output or TCP/UDP network output, hopefully without too much translation!
